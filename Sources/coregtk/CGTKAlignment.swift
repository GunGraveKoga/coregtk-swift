/// 
/// The #GtkAlignment widget controls the alignment and size of its child widget.
/// It has four settings: xscale, yscale, xalign, and yalign.
/// The scale settings are used to specify how much the child widget should
/// expand to fill the space allocated to the #GtkAlignment.
/// The values can range from 0 (meaning the child doesnâ€™t expand at all) to
/// 1 (meaning the child expands to fill all of the available space).
/// The align settings are used to place the child widget within the available
/// area. The values range from 0 (top or left) to 1 (bottom or right).
/// Of course, if the scale settings are both set to 1, the alignment settings
/// have no effect.
/// GtkAlignment has been deprecated in 3.14 and should not be used in
/// newly-written code. The desired effect can be achieved by using the
/// #GtkWidget:halign, #GtkWidget:valign and #GtkWidget:margin properties on the
/// child widget.
