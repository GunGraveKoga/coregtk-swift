/// 
/// #GtkRecentChooserMenu is a widget suitable for displaying recently used files
/// inside a menu.  It can be used to set a sub-menu of a #GtkMenuItem using
/// gtk_menu_item_set_submenu(), or as the menu of a #GtkMenuToolButton.
/// Note that #GtkRecentChooserMenu does not have any methods of its own. Instead,
/// you should use the functions that work on a #GtkRecentChooser.
/// Note also that #GtkRecentChooserMenu does not support multiple filters, as it
/// has no way to let the user choose between them as the #GtkRecentChooserWidget
/// and #GtkRecentChooserDialog widgets do. Thus using gtk_recent_chooser_add_filter()
/// on a #GtkRecentChooserMenu widget will yield the same effects as using
/// gtk_recent_chooser_set_filter(), replacing any currently set filter
/// with the supplied filter; gtk_recent_chooser_remove_filter() will remove
/// any currently set #GtkRecentFilter object and will unset the current filter;
/// gtk_recent_chooser_list_filters() will return a list containing a single
/// #GtkRecentFilter object.
/// Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

	/// have an icon, representing its MIME type, and a number, for mnemonic
	/// access.
	/// This widget implements the #GtkRecentChooser interface.
	/// This widget creates its own #GtkRecentManager object.  See the
	/// gtk_recent_chooser_menu_new_for_manager() function to know how to create
	/// a #GtkRecentChooserMenu widget bound to another #GtkRecentManager object.

	/// object or if you wish to share a common #GtkRecentManager object
	/// among multiple #GtkRecentChooser widgets.
