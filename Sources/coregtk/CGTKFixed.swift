/// The #GtkFixed widget is a container which can place child widgets
/// at fixed positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. #GtkFixed
/// performs no automatic layout management.
/// For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
/// you from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it
/// results in broken applications.  With #GtkFixed, the following
/// things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
/// other display bugs:
/// - Themes, which may change widget sizes.
/// - Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
/// change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
/// users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
/// default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.
/// - Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
/// display of non-English text will use a different font in many
/// cases.
/// In addition, #GtkFixed does not pay attention to text direction and thus may
/// produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left languages
/// such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK+ will order containers
/// appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to the right of the
/// thing they label when using an RTL language, but it canâ€™t do that with
/// #GtkFixed. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on the text direction,
/// you would need to manually detect it and adjust child positions accordingly.
/// Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
/// GUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other
/// elements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your
/// application.
/// If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
/// and prefer the simplicity of #GtkFixed, by all means use the
/// widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.
/// See also #GtkLayout, which shares the ability to perform fixed positioning
/// of child widgets and additionally adds custom drawing and scrollability.
