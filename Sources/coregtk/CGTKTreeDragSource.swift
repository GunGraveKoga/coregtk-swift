	/// Asks the #GtkTreeDragSource to delete the row at @path, because
	/// it was moved somewhere else via drag-and-drop. Returns %FALSE

	/// some model-specific reason. Should robustly handle a @path no
	/// longer found in the model!
	/// - Parameters:
	///	- path: OpaquePointer! (GtkTreePath*)
	/// - Returns: Bool (gboolean)
	func dragDataDelete(path: OpaquePointer!) -> Bool

	/// Asks the #GtkTreeDragSource to fill in @selection_data with a
	/// representation of the row at @path. @selection_data->target gives
	/// the required type of the data.  Should robustly handle a @path no
	/// longer found in the model!
	/// - Parameters:
	///	- path: OpaquePointer! (GtkTreePath*)
	///	- selectionData: OpaquePointer! (GtkSelectionData*)
	/// - Returns: Bool (gboolean)
	func dragDataGet(path: OpaquePointer!, selectionData: OpaquePointer!) -> Bool

	/// Asks the #GtkTreeDragSource whether a particular row can be used as
	/// the source of a DND operation. If the source doesnâ€™t implement
	/// this interface, the row is assumed draggable.
	/// - Parameters:
	///	- path: OpaquePointer! (GtkTreePath*)
	/// - Returns: Bool (gboolean)
