/// The #GtkEditable interface is an interface which should be implemented by

/// for generically manipulating an editable widget, a large number of action
/// signals used for key bindings, and several signals that an application can
/// connect to to modify the behavior of a widget.
/// As an example of the latter usage, by connecting
/// the following handler to #GtkEditable::insert-text, an application
/// can convert all entry into a widget into uppercase.
/// ## Forcing entry to uppercase.

	/// This call doesnâ€™t do anything if there is no selected text.

	/// Deletes a sequence of characters. The characters that are deleted are
	/// those characters at positions from @start_pos up to, but not including
	/// @end_pos. If @end_pos is negative, then the characters deleted
	/// are those from @start_pos to the end of the text.

	/// - Parameters:
	///	- startPos: gint (gint)
	///	- endPos: gint (gint)

	/// of the content of the editable.

	func getPosition() -> gint

	/// Retrieves the selection bound of the editable. start_pos will be filled
	/// with the start of the selection and @end_pos with end. If no text was
	/// selected both will be identical and %FALSE will be returned.
	/// Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.

	///	- startPos: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int32>! (gint*)
	///	- endPos: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int32>! (gint*)
	/// - Returns: Bool (gboolean)

	///	- newTextLength: gint (gint)
	///	- position: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int32>! (gint*)

	/// Selects a region of text. The characters that are selected are
	/// those characters at positions from @start_pos up to, but not
	/// including @end_pos. If @end_pos is negative, then the
	/// characters selected are those characters from @start_pos to
	/// the end of the text.
	/// Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes.
	/// - Parameters:
	///	- startPos: gint (gint)
	///	- endPos: gint (gint)
	func selectRegion(startPos: gint, endPos: gint) -> Swift.Void

	/// Determines if the user can edit the text in the editable
	/// widget or not.
	/// - Parameters:
	///	- isEditable: Bool (gboolean)
	func setEditable(isEditable: Bool) -> Swift.Void

	/// Sets the cursor position in the editable to the given value.
	/// The cursor is displayed before the character with the given (base 0)
	/// index in the contents of the editable. The value must be less than or
	/// equal to the number of characters in the editable. A value of -1
	/// indicates that the position should be set after the last character
	/// of the editable. Note that @position is in characters, not in bytes.
	/// - Parameters:
