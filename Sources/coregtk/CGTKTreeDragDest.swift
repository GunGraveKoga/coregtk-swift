	/// Asks the #GtkTreeDragDest to insert a row before the path @dest,
	/// deriving the contents of the row from @selection_data. If @dest is
	/// outside the tree so that inserting before it is impossible, %FALSE
	/// will be returned. Also, %FALSE may be returned if the new row is
	/// not created for some model-specific reason.  Should robustly handle
	/// a @dest no longer found in the model!
	/// - Parameters:
	///	- dest: OpaquePointer! (GtkTreePath*)
	///	- selectionData: OpaquePointer! (GtkSelectionData*)
	/// - Returns: Bool (gboolean)
	func dragDataReceived(dest: OpaquePointer!, selectionData: OpaquePointer!) -> Bool

	/// Determines whether a drop is possible before the given @dest_path,
	/// at the same depth as @dest_path. i.e., can we drop the data in
	/// @selection_data at that location. @dest_path does not have to
	/// exist; the return value will almost certainly be %FALSE if the
	/// parent of @dest_path doesnâ€™t exist, though.
	/// - Parameters:
	///	- destPath: OpaquePointer! (GtkTreePath*)
	///	- selectionData: OpaquePointer! (GtkSelectionData*)
	/// - Returns: Bool (gboolean)
