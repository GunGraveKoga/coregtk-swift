/// 
/// The #GtkViewport widget acts as an adaptor class, implementing
/// scrollability for child widgets that lack their own scrolling
/// capabilities. Use GtkViewport to scroll child widgets such as
/// #GtkGrid, #GtkBox, and so on.
/// If a widget has native scrolling abilities, such as #GtkTextView,
/// #GtkTreeView or #GtkIconView, it can be added to a #GtkScrolledWindow
/// with gtk_container_add(). If a widget does not, you must first add the
/// widget to a #GtkViewport, then add the viewport to the scrolled window.
/// gtk_container_add() does this automatically if a child that does not
/// implement #GtkScrollable is added to a #GtkScrolledWindow, so you can
/// ignore the presence of the viewport.
/// The GtkViewport will start scrolling content only if allocated less
/// than the child widgetâ€™s minimum size in a given orientation.
/// # CSS nodes
/// GtkViewport has a single CSS node with name viewport.
